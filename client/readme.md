The AccumulativeShadows
 component is a built-in component in Three.js that allows you to create a shadow effect for a 3D object. 
  
  The temporal
 prop is used to enable temporal accumulation, which means that the shadows will gradually become more defined over time.
 The frames
 prop specifies the number of frames to accumulate the shadows over. In this case, it is set to 60, which means that the shadows will become more defined over the course of 60 frames.
 he alphaTest
 prop is used to control the transparency of the shadows. A value of 0.85
 means that any pixels with an alpha value less than 0.85 will be discarded.
 The scale
 prop is used to control the size of the shadow map. A larger value will result in a higher-quality shadow effect, but may also be more resource-intensive.

scale
 prop is used to control the size of the shadow map. A larger value will result in a higher-quality shadow effect, but may also be more resource-intensive.
 The 
radius
 prop specifies the radius of the light source. A larger value will result in a softer and more diffuse lighting effect.
The 
intensity
 prop specifies the brightness of the light source. A larger value will result in a brighter lighting effect.
The 
ambient
 prop specifies the ambient light level. A larger value will result in a brighter overall lighting effect.
The 
position
 prop specifies the position of the light source relative to the 3D object.
 The 
reader
 function is not defined in this code, but it is presumably a function that takes a file as input and returns a Promise that resolves to the contents of the file.
Once the Promise returned by 
reader
 is resolved, the 
then
 method is called with a callback function that takes a 
result
 argument. This 
result
 argument presumably contains the contents of the file that was read.
